# Why we have, and have not "free will"

For generations philosophers, theologians, and people in general haver wondered about one, most important, question: Do we, as humans, posses free will.
Me, as a simple human, not a studied professor of philosophy or medicine might probably offers little insight.
However I have rather recently gained a, most likely known, insight which provides a very different answer altogether.

We simultaneously posses, and do not posses, free will.
This seems a strange contradiction, however after careful consideration I believe this to not just be a good answer, but a consistent one as well, and satisfying in multiple respects.
Fist let me explain the "not" part, since it is the easiest one.

For many years now we have studied fundamental sciences like Physics, Chemistry, and Biology.
What we have learned is devastating to the idea of free will.
Nature operates like a machine and following strict rules.
Sure, at the fundamental level of Chemistry and Physics sits probability, which sounds "unpredictable", but it really isn't.
What a horrible world it would be if Chemistry and Biology was significantly unpredictable.
We literally would be unable to trust our senses.
No, "large scale" Chemistry, and this means a few thousand molecules, which is a miniscule amount of matter, behaves, for the most part, rather predictable.
This is necessary to facilitate intelligent life such as ours, or life in general.

As a direct result however we must accept the "cruel" reality that Biology, and therefore the human species, behaves much like a machine.
This is more apparent in simpler organisms, where we can observe the direct change in behaviour given altering input.

In fact any "intelligent" organism, and by this I simply mean any organism posessing some form of memory, behaves much like a state machine.
Input received via the sensory apparatus alters some internal state (memory) and produces output via the locomotor apparatus.
Two identical organisms, in terms of internal state and processing mechanics, provided with the exact same input, will produce identical output and new internal state.

This does not shine a good light on the idea of free will.
If out internal state machine is so deterministic, why do I believe "free will" exists regardless?

The clue lies in how one defines free will.
A truly "free" decider would given a choice of `n` scenarios choose in a way completely intrinsic to the decider itself.
No exterior influence biases the decider.
This results in choices depending on the initial decider.
Essentially random with initial bias accounted for.

This bias however could not arise from the situation itself but the intrinsic bias of the decider.
Imagine a scenario where one has to decide between between appointing a promotion between two workers.
One happens to have brown hair, one happens to have blonde hair.
The brown haired worker performed on average better than the blonde worker.
A "free" decider may only decide in accordance with its intrinsic bias.
Therefore had the decider an initial bias to blonde people, he may choose the blonde person over the brown haired own, despite it being a less skilled worker.
Similarly a decider with no bias towards hair colour would choose entirely randomly between those two people, possibly selecting the worse fit for the job.

The conclusion we can draw from this example is that humans as such do not desire free will.
What a human desires is "intelligent decision making".
We want to be able to "freely" select the best fit out of a selection of choices.
And here "free" doe not mean uninfluenced, but rather "by our own weighing function".
We want to evaluate criteria for selection in a way we have previously developed and refined and form a decision based on those criteria.
We would like for those criteria and evaluation methods not to be externally imposed upon us.
And *this* unlike the "free" will, I'd argue we posess.

I propose the following conclusion: Humans posses free will, because the freedom humans desire is not the freedom to make a non-extenrally biased decision, but to make a decision considered intelligent by ones own standards, which we are capable of.
