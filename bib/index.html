            <div class="abstract"><p>Finding privacy bugs in software today usually requires onerous
manual audits. Code analysis tools could help, but existing
tools aren't sufficiently practical and ergonomic to be used.</p>
<p>Paralegal is a static analysis tool to find privacy bugs in Rust
programs. Key to Paralegal's practicality is its distribution of
work between the program analyzer, privacy engineers, and
application developers. Privacy engineers express a high-level
privacy policy over markers, which application developers
then apply to source code entities. Paralegal extracts a Program
Dependence Graph (PDG) from the program, leveraging
Rust's ownership type system to model the behavior of library
code. Paralegal augments the PDG with the developers' markers
and checks privacy policies against the marked PDG.</p>
<p>In an evaluation on eight real-world applications, Paralegal
found real privacy bugs, including two previously unknown
ones. Paralegal supports a broader range of policies than information
flow control (IFC) and CodeQL, a widely-used code
analysis engine. Paralegal is fast enough to deploy interactively,
and its markers are easy to maintain as code evolves.</p>

            <div class="abstract"><p>Type checkers are the most commonly used form of static analysis, but their
design is coupled to the rest of the language, making it hard or impossible
to bring new kinds of reasoning to existing unmodified code.</p>
<p>We propose a novel approach to checking advanced type invariants and
properties in unmodified source code, while retaining the speed and ease of
simple syntax directed type checkers. The insight is that by combining a
relatively deep program analysis (symbolic execution) with an unusual choice
of program abstraction (based on program slicing), it appears possible to
reconstitute type-checking as a special case of a more general analysis,
which the abstraction reduces mostly to 'type-level' reasoning, largely
discarding the 'value-level' work of the program.</p>
<p>We implement a first simple prototype that demonstrates this idea by
checking the safety of generic pointers in C, potentially bringing benefits
roughly comparable with Milner's polymorphism.</p>

            <div class="abstract"><p>The Structured Query Language (SQL) is the de facto standard for database
programming. SQL is a declarative language, letting programmers write short
queries easily and allowing for aggressive performance optimizations.</p>
<p>However this style diverges greatly from the widely used sequential
programming style. This makes complex queries hard to write and understand
[21].</p>
<p>SQL also does not allow for the use of state. Algorithms that use state to
achieve efficiency are impossible to implement [12]. State can only be used
in so called User Defined Functions (UDF) which come with a significant
performance penalty, because the optimizations are no longer available.</p>
<p>In this work we improve upon the integration of imperative User Defined
Functions. We use a the parallelizing compiler Ohua to generate query
fragments from the UDF's. These fragments run like native SQL queries and
can benefit from database optimizations, such as parallelizing.</p>
<p>The fragments contain operators generated by the compiler, which are state
enabled. This allows us to express efficient stateful queries, as in [12].</p>

            <div class="abstract"><p>Dataflow execution models are used to build highly scalable parallel
systems. A programming model that targets parallel dataflow execution must
answer the following question: How can parallelism between two dependent
nodes in a dataflow graph be exploited? This is difficult when the dataflow
language or programming model is implemented by a monad, as is common in the
functional community, since expressing dependence between nodes by a monadic
bind suggests sequential execution.</p>
<p>Even in monadic constructs that explicitly separate state from computation,
problems arise due to the need to reason about opaquely defined state.
Specifically, when abstractions of the chosen programming model do not
enable adequate reasoning about state, it is difficult to detect parallelism
between composed stateful computations.</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose a programming model that enables the composition
of stateful computations and still exposes opportunities for
parallelization. We also introduce smap, a higher-order function that can
exploit parallelism in stateful computations. We present an implementation
of our programming model and <code>smap</code> in Haskell and show that basic concepts
from functional reactive programming can be built on top of our programming
model with little effort. We compare these implementations to a
state-of-the-art approach using monad-par and LVars to expose parallelism
explicitly and reach the same level of performance, showing that our
programming model successfully extracts parallelism that is present in an
algorithm. Further evaluation shows that smap is expressive enough to
implement parallel reductions and our programming model resolves
short-comings of the stream-based programming model for current
state-of-the-art big data processing systems.</p>

of an application that can be executed in data parallel fashion. It has been
recently reported, however, that these systems fail to translate hardware
improvements, such as increased network bandwidth, into a higher throughput.
This is particularly the case for applications that have inherent
sequential, computationally intensive phases. In this paper, we analyze the
data processing cores of state-of-the-art big data systems to find the cause
for these scalability problems. We identify design patterns in the code that
are suitable for pipeline and task-level parallelism, potentially increasing
application performance. As a proof of concept, we rewrite parts of the
Hadoop MapReduce framework in an implicit parallel language that exploits
this parallelism without adding code complexity. Our experiments on a data
analytics workload show throughput speedups of up to 3.5x.</p>

are composed of several layers of micro-services. While this modularity
provides scalability to the system, the I/O associated with each service
request strongly impacts its performance. In this context, writing concise
programs which execute I/O efficiently is especially challenging. In this
paper, we introduce Ÿauhau, a novel compile-time solution. Ÿauhau reduces
the number of I/O calls through rewrites on a simple expression language. To
execute I/O concurrently, it lowers the expression language to a dataflow
representation. Our approach can be used alongside an existing programming
language, permitting the use of legacy code. We describe an implementation
in the JVM and use it to evaluate our approach. Experiments show that Ÿauhau
can significantly improve I/O, both in terms of the number of I/O calls and
concurrent execution. Ÿauhau outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with
similar goals.</p>

services, is the inherent latency of I/O operations. Disk I/O, database
access and network bound communication is frequent, especially in data
processing systems and distributed service infrastructures. Making I/O
efficient is cumbersome, involves asynchronous programming and caching and
hinders modularity when attempting to perform batch jobs. There have been a
few solutions proposed to automate this, first and foremost Haxl, a Haskell
library. We proposed an alternate, improved implementation called Ÿauhau. It
leverages dataflow to produce even better performance while being
independent from any particular code writing style in a minimal Embedded
Domain-Specific Language (EDSL). In this thesis we first explore the
techniques used by Ÿauhau to make I/O more efficient. Secondly we identify,
explain and solve issues in Ÿauhau arising from control flow. Furthermore we
suggest new optimisations for the compiler and implement safety guards for
handling side effects.</p>
