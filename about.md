This is my homepage and blog. I try to make this blog mostly about interesting or perhaps even important knowledge or events which I happen to come in contact with.

Furthermore this website contains a [repository for information on projects](/projects/) I am, or have been working on, usually containing a more personal look on the project, why I perhaps started/joined it or how I feel the development is going.

All pages on this site are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax){:target="_blank"} using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"} for building and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com){:target="_blank"}. All this is open source software and free services that I wholeheartedly recommend.
