The tool supports arbitrary Rust codebases and requires no changes to the application code, other than a few annotations. It supports custom privacy and security policies which lets you tailor the tool to your specific domain and use case. It can also be used on library-only crates. If this interests you, check out the online documentation and the repository.\nI contributed to Kani, a model checker for Rust programs. I designed and implemented the first contract mechanism for Kani, which enables users to take advantage of modular verification where they can first verify a function against its contract and then use the contract as a cheap assumption when verifying callers. For more information, see my blog post on the Kani blog.\nI contributed to Ohua, a parallelizing compiler. Among other things I implemented an optimization that batches I/O operations to reduce network roundtrips. You can find more information about the compiler on the website.\n\nYou may also be interested in the list of scientific publications I was involved in.\nPersonal stuff\nIn my spare time I like to climb and boulder, both indoors and outdoors. During\nthe warmer months you'll find me hiking a mountain and during the colder ones on a ski slope if I can help it.\nI enjoy playing video games, making music and learning about the big issues of our time, like inequality and climate change.\n\nA few blog posts I wrote about my time in England\nArchive of a technical blog I used to write.

Code analysis tools could help, but existing\ntools aren't sufficiently practical and ergonomic to be used.\nParalegal is a static analysis tool to find privacy bugs in Rust\nprograms. Key to Paralegal's practicality is its distribution of\nwork between the program analyzer, privacy engineers, and\napplication developers. Privacy engineers express a high-level\nprivacy policy over markers, which application developers\nthen apply to source code entities. Paralegal extracts a Program\nDependence Graph (PDG) from the program, leveraging\nRust's ownership type system to model the behavior of library\ncode. Paralegal augments the PDG with the developers' markers\nand checks privacy policies against the marked PDG.\nIn an evaluation on eight real-world applications, Paralegal\nfound real privacy bugs, including two previously unknown\nones. Paralegal supports a broader range of policies than information\nflow control (IFC) and CodeQL, a widely-used code\nanalysis engine. Paralegal is fast enough to deploy interactively,\nand its markers are easy to maintain as code evolves.\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n        2023-07-10:\n        \n            \n            K9db: Privacy-Compliant Storage For Web Applications By Construction\n              \n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                     Kinan Dak Albab, Ishan Sharma, Justus Adam, Benjamin Klimnik, Aaron Jeyaraj, Raj Paul, Artem Agvanian, Leonhard Spiegelberg, Malte Schwarzkopf  in\n                    17th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI'23) \n                \n            \n             \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n        2020-11-19:\n        \n            \n            Type checking beyond type checkers, via Slice &amp; Run\n              [preprint]\n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                     Justus Adam, Stephen Kell  in\n                    11th Workshop on Tools for Automatic Program Analysis \n                \n            \n              Show abstract:\n            \n            Type checkers are the most commonly used form of static analysis, but their\ndesign is coupled to the rest of the language, making it hard or impossible\nto bring new kinds of reasoning to existing unmodified code.\nWe propose a novel approach to checking advanced type invariants and\nproperties in unmodified source code, while retaining the speed and ease of\nsimple syntax directed type checkers. The insight is that by combining a\nrelatively deep program analysis (symbolic execution) with an unusual choice\nof program abstraction (based on program slicing), it appears possible to\nreconstitute type-checking as a special case of a more general analysis,\nwhich the abstraction reduces mostly to 'type-level' reasoning, largely\ndiscarding the 'value-level' work of the program.\nWe implement a first simple prototype that demonstrates this idea by\nchecking the safety of generic pointers in C, potentially bringing benefits\nroughly comparable with Milner's polymorphism.\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n        2019-12-12:\n        \n             Ohua-powered, Semi-transparent UDF's in the Noria Database  [pdf] \n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                    Masters Thesis Justus Adam  at\n                    Technische Universität Dresden\n                    \n                \n            \n            2-page Extended Abstract as short introduction\n  Show abstract:\n            \n            The Structured Query Language (SQL) is the de facto standard for database\nprogramming. SQL is a declarative language, letting programmers write short\nqueries easily and allowing for aggressive performance optimizations.\nHowever this style diverges greatly from the widely used sequential\nprogramming style. This makes complex queries hard to write and understand\n[21].\nSQL also does not allow for the use of state. Algorithms that use state to\nachieve efficiency are impossible to implement [12]. State can only be used\nin so called User Defined Functions (UDF) which come with a significant\nperformance penalty, because the optimizations are no longer available.\nIn this work we improve upon the integration of imperative User Defined\nFunctions. We use a the parallelizing compiler Ohua to generate query\nfragments from the UDF's. These fragments run like native SQL queries and\ncan benefit from database optimizations, such as parallelizing.\nThe fragments contain operators generated by the compiler, which are state\nenabled. This allows us to express efficient stateful queries, as in [12].\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n        2019-07-23:\n        \n            \n            STCLang: State Thread Composition as a Foundation for Monadic Dataflow Parallelism\n              \n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                     Sebastian Ertel, Justus Adam, Norman A.

A programming model that targets parallel dataflow execution must\nanswer the following question: How can parallelism between two dependent\nnodes in a dataflow graph be exploited? This is difficult when the dataflow\nlanguage or programming model is implemented by a monad, as is common in the\nfunctional community, since expressing dependence between nodes by a monadic\nbind suggests sequential execution.\nEven in monadic constructs that explicitly separate state from computation,\nproblems arise due to the need to reason about opaquely defined state.\nSpecifically, when abstractions of the chosen programming model do not\nenable adequate reasoning about state, it is difficult to detect parallelism\nbetween composed stateful computations.\nIn this paper, we propose a programming model that enables the composition\nof stateful computations and still exposes opportunities for\nparallelization. We also introduce smap, a higher-order function that can\nexploit parallelism in stateful computations. We present an implementation\nof our programming model and smap in Haskell and show that basic concepts\nfrom functional reactive programming can be built on top of our programming\nmodel with little effort. We compare these implementations to a\nstate-of-the-art approach using monad-par and LVars to expose parallelism\nexplicitly and reach the same level of performance, showing that our\nprogramming model successfully extracts parallelism that is present in an\nalgorithm. Further evaluation shows that smap is expressive enough to\nimplement parallel reductions and our programming model resolves\nshort-comings of the stream-based programming model for current\nstate-of-the-art big data processing systems.\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n        2018-02-24:\n        \n            \n            Supporting Fine-grained Dataflow Parallelism in Big Data Systems.\n              \n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                     Sebastian Ertel, Justus Adam, Jeronimo Castrillon  in\n                    PMAM@ PPoPP \n                \n            \n              Show abstract:\n            \n            Big data systems scale with the number of cores in a cluster for the parts\nof an application that can be executed in data parallel fashion.

There were a lot of big and ugly &lt;a&gt; tags in there  and the whole thing felt so ... static. Actually writing a &lt;ul&gt; element by hand in html felt just ... wrong. Fortunately I had just learnt about jekyll collections and was using them to create some project pages. So I created a new collection called 'quick_facts' and refactored the messages into individual .md's containing markdown source for the messages, plus the YAML Front Matter and added this little line instead of the giant blobs of text from before.\n\nThe if forloop.last block adds a 'last' class to the last element to allow me to add some pretty separators using border-bottom.\nNow if I want to edit a message, instead of digging around in lines upon lines of raw html code I can go straight to the message file containing some nice markdown source.\nThe best feature in my eyes though is that if I want to add, replace or delete I just have to add/replace/delete .md files in the _quick_facts directory and it'll process them automatically.\nDisplaying excerpts and descriptions\nOn the website I've had before I was using Drupal which by default displayed a kind of teaser on the overviews. I liked that so I replicated it in Jekyll.\nBut I wanted to do more, or more precisely I didn't realize at first that Jekyll offers an excerpt attribute on he document objects and so I added something of my own making.\n\nWhich would, if a document object had a description attribute print the first 100 characters of it in a smaller, lighter font.\nHowever I discovered that the document objects actually have an excerpt attribute which will generate a teaser based on the content itself, so I combined the two. Furthermore I found out that you can simply add your own custom variables to the _config.yml which will then be available via the site attribute, so I refactored the teaser length such that it is set in the main config as quick_view_length. And here's the final result:\n\nNow it will either print the first paragraph of the page (jekyll's default excerpt style) or a custom description, if you provide one, perhaps if the first paragraph is not very representative of the rest of the content.\nYou can check out how it looks on the homepage.\n","id":"https://justus.science/blog/a-sweetass-sidebar/","title":"A sweetass sidebar in Jekyll"},"https://justus.science/blog/basic-auth-haskell/":{"body":"Prelude\nI've recently needed to make a basic, authenticated HTTP request in Haskell, however I found it difficult to find examples and documentation on the web so I thought I'd share my findings with the world in the form of a blog post (and a gist).\nFirst of all, in order to use http in Haskell you'll want to use the right library. Fortunately for me I already knew a library which is sort of the standard library for Haskell when it comes to http (client side). The aptly named HTTP library.\nThe Hackage page for the hackage page for the HTTP library albeit being helpful does not provide very many examples on how to use it and more importantly does not provide a lot of guidance for beginners when it comes to choosing the right submodule for a particular task.\nI the past I've mostly dealt with the very basic Network.HTTP package. Which is reasonably easy to understand and totally sufficient for simple, unauthenticated GET requests. However if you want to do more complicated things like for example auth or cookies it is too low level. For those more complicated requests you'll want to use the Network.Browser module, which seems a bit intimidating at first.\nNetwork.Browser defines the BrowserAction Monad, which is basically IO combined with (Browser)State. All further actions are then defined on this BrowserAction.\nBrowser basics\nThe main action with the BrowserAction Monad, outside of BrowserAction, is the browse function. This function evaluates the BrowserAction and returns whatever contents it is holding, very much like IO. This is the usual entry and exit point for Browser related computation in the HTTP library.\nThe basic function for performing requests is the request function, which given a Request object performs the request, ending again inside a BrowserAction.\nRequest objects can either be created by hand, or with the utility functions from Network.HTTP or by using the utility functions in Network.HTTP.Browser itself.\nThe quickest one of these to get started is using the getRequest function from Network.HTTP, it just takes a String and returns a Request.\nWhich means a basic request starts like this\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nHandling URI's\nIf you want to be slightly more fancy and safe with your requests, instead of using the getRequest function you can first parse your URI using the Network.URI module from the network-uri package (which is what getRequest does internally). This module provides several ways of parsing URI's that return either Maybe's, Either's or throwing exceptions, if you're okay with throwing exceptions. But they all return URI type objects.\nGetting those URI's into a Request can be done by for example defaultGetRequest which takes a URI and returns a Request that the Browser can carry out.\nRequests with forms\nSending requests with actual (x-www-urlencoded) payload is, as I discovered with joy, similarly easy with the Browser module. It provides a function called formToRequest which takes a Form and URI, returning a Request and a data constructor for Form which takes a RequestMethod for which the constructors are simply POST, GET etc and a list of 2-Tuples of Strings for the payload values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nRequests with Authentication\nEven though it took me a relatively long time to figure out how to do authentication with this library, it is actually relatively simple.\nThe BrowserAction will actually handle most of the hard authentication work for you, provided the webpage you're visiting communicates in the canonical way, using HTTP error codes.\nWhen performing the POST or GET request with the request function the Browser action will check the returned status code and take action depending on the code. The two codes that are of interest are 200 (Status OK) and 401 (Unauthorized).\nIn case of 200 the server has computed the resource you requested and BrowserAction will simply return the body of the request. In case of 401 the server requests you to authenticate to it.\nIf the server requests the authentication, BrowserAction will attempt to satisfy the authentication by fetching a Username, Password combination from a generator function and sending a request for authentication to the server, retrying the original request afterwards.\nThe type signature for the generator function is URI -&gt; String -&gt; IO (Maybe (String, String)) and by default is equivalent to \\_ _ -&gt; return Nothing aka there will be no authentication for any URI.\nYou can however set your own generator function with the setAuthorityGen function in the BrowserAction.\nA few things to note about the generator function\n\nThe two arguments provided are the full URI for the requested resource and the so called realm, which is a message the server sends to unauthorized clients.\nThus your generator function can return different Username, Password combinations depending on the URI.\nThe generator function returns a maybe. If you don't recognize the URI that it is trying to authenticate for you don't have to provide any credentials by simply returning Nothing\nThe return type of the generator function is an IO computation, which means you may read the credentials from a file or request them from a different server.\n\nHow does this look in practice?\nA very simple authenticated request could look something like this.\n\nAnother version of the provider function, for multiple URI's would be by hardcoding an association list of them and fetching from the list. Like in the example below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nSending literal JSON\nI've also recently had the pleasure to be in a situation where I've wanted to create some very simple json, for which the proper way (via the aeson library) would have felt like overkill,\nI wanted to create the output with just string concatenation and then send it to the client. Unfortunately the warp library, which is sort of the standard web server library for Haskell, uses ByteStrings for output. Now if you do things the canonical way, the aeson way it'll create a unicode encoded ByteString for you and there's nothing to worry about.\nThe JSON standard requires the text to be unicode encoded. However when using string literals and concatenation it becomes quite obvious that ByteString is inherently not meant for unicode. So in order to get a Unicode encoded String you'll have create Text rather than a String and then specifically encode it as a unicode ByteString. You can do this by importing the Data.Text.Encoding module or the Data.Text.Lazy.Encoding module if you, like me, are dealing with warp and need a lazy ByteString for output and then simply use the encodeUtf8 function on your Text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n","id":"https://justus.science/blog/basic-auth-haskell/","title":"Basic authenticated http requests and forms in Haskell"},"https://justus.science/blog/cname-shenanigans/":{"body":"For a month or so I've now had the 'justus.science' domain, on which, amongst other things, this homepage can be found. Sort of around the same time I moved host, from uberspace to GitHub Pages, and infrastructure, from Drupal to the (much) more lightweight Jekyll.\nBy default GitHub pages domains look like this: username.github.io. In my case that would be justusadam.github.io, which is neither short nor particularly pretty. You can add custom domains to a GitHub page though, which I intended to make use of.\nIn order to add a custom domain to a GitHub page you have to configure the appropriate DNS entry with the provider. I, as per usual, read the manual fast and loosely and as a result thought the DNS entry had to be a CNAME, a belief which was reinforced by the fact that the file that has to be put into the repository and tells GitHub what the custom domain for the page is called, bears the name 'CNAME'.\nSo I registered a CNAME entry with united domains. The domain resolved as expected and the address bar in the browser was showing the right thing (the custom domain), everything seemed right with the world.\nThen I tried to set up email with the new domain, as I had done with the other domain before by setting an MX entry pointing to the uberspace mailserver. It didn't work. I sent a few test mails, none of them arrived. The SMTP server tried three times and eventually gave up. Every mail was getting dropped. I changed the entry and redirected to gmail instead, that seemed to work1.\nI could not figure out what was causing the issue. I decided it probably was the mailserver that for some reason could not deal with the new domain ending, a claim that, as I realize now, was pretty stupid. I decided to leave it for now, since in my mind the error did not appear to be on my side and I did not depend on the mail addresses.\nThat could have been the end of it, if not for a couple of days ago, when I decided it was time to pick the issue back up and get it sorted out. I sent an email to the excellent uberspace support and told them the server was not receiving mails to one of my domains and what I thought the reason was. They came back to me with a simple fact that made the problem obvious.\nTurns out setting a CNAME entry for a domain pretty much overrides everything. CNAME's are designed to redirect all traffic to a (sub)domain to another domain, all traffic, including email. When A CNAME has been set the DNS server will ignore any other entry for that same name or flat out reject you setting any additional entries for the domain. Thus by setting one for 'justus.science' I inadvertently directed all emails going to any-address@justus.science to GitHub pages, which does not provide an email service and as a result dropped them.\nFixing it was rather simple. A second look at the GitHub pages help pages revealed that, any type of DNS entry could be used for a page (and why shouldn't it). So I changed the CNAME entrty to an A entry2 to GitHub's IP, waited for the TTL to expire, send test mails again and suddenly they all arrived as expected, where expected. The MX entry was in effect.\n\n\n\nKnowing what I know now it might be that I am not remembering the timeline correctly and it might be I had the email redirect before I set the CNAME entry for the site and changed it to an MX later, that would make more sense at least. ↩\n\n\nIf you'd like to know more about setting A names with GitHub, here is the official help page. ↩\n\n\n\n","id":"https://justus.science/blog/cname-shenanigans/","title":"Trouble with CNAME's"},"https://justus.science/blog/creating-executables-with-actions/":{"body":"With the release of GitHub Actions we have\ngained an incredibly powerful tool when it comes to testing and publishing\nsoftware hosted on GitHub. Actions lets you essentially perform arbitrary\ncomputing tasks whenever certain events in your repository are triggered. While\nplatforms like Circle-CI or Travis have offered similar capabilities for a\nwhile, Actions make some of those tasks significantly more convenient due to how\ndeeply it is integrated with GitHub.\nWhat I want to show you in this post is how you can provide downloadable\ncompiled binaries and tarballs for users of your projects using just a few lines\nof Actions configuration. Having prebuilt binaries like this makes it\nsignificantly easier for new users to check out and start using your project,\nespecially those less familiar with the language and tooling you use.\nIn this post I will be describing a project written in\nHaskell and built using\nstack. However except for the build commands\nnone of the configuration is unique to this toolchain and you should be able to\neasily adapt it to your own build method.\nI've created a test repo to tinker with this stuff which you can find\nhere.\nThere you can find the configuration I describe below, as well as see the\nuploaded assets on the releases page.\nIf you just want to see the configuration I use and figure the rest out for\nyourself, take a look at the section Configuration. After\nthat I'll explain in more detail the individual steps taken in\nthe configuration and I'll close with some Caveats that apply to\nthis method.\nThe next section is about my motivation for getting involved with this and\nwriting this post. If you are only here for the technical stuff you can safely\nskip it.\nMotivation\nI recently found myself wanting to check out a project called\ngitit which is essentially a small server that\nserves a wiki. All the wiki really is is a git repository of files with support\nfor several formats, such as markdown. The server lets you view, create and edit\nthe files in the browser and persists your changes by committing. Its a nice,\nsimple piece of software, especially because the stored data can easily be\nhandled outside of the server, making it easy to migrate or interact with from\nan editor.\nWhat I found rather annoying is that, given the features, this piece of software\nshould be a simple, small binary with perhaps a few static assets. And it is.\nHowever the only method available for acquisition is building from source. Now\n💚 Haskell, but it is notorious for its slow build times. To make matters\nworse, gitit, in order to support multiple file formats, depends the library\nversion of a software called pandoc, which is a large,\nmulti-format document rendering and conversion software. This means to build\ngitit the large pandoc software has to be built, pulling in and building all\nof its many dependencies. If I remember correctly a total of around 120 Haskell\nlibraries were downloaded and built, which took over 30 minutes on a quad core\nmachine, just to make this simple, tiny 40mb binary. Not to mention that someone\nwho doesn't have Haskell installed would also have to download the build tools\nghc, stack, cabal etc.\nGiven how scary and involved this process is and how obscure Haskell as a\nlanguage is I feel that this simple software would be significantly more\naccessible to people if it provided prebuilt binaries that one would just have\nto download and run. Takes but a few seconds and avoids having to explain the\nbuild process. And since the project is already using GitHub Actions as CI,\nadding another config to build assets on release seems like a pretty\nstraightforward addition.\nBack in the day I used to so similar things on Travis, building and uploading\nbinaries. Back then it required you to create a custom API key for interacting\nwith the GitHub releases and storing that in Travis as well as properly talking\nto the GitHub API to upload stuff. It may be a bit much to ask of authors to set\nup travis and the keys etc, etc. But since Actions needs none of that I feel\nit's low-effort enough for virtually anyone to just start using it. Hence this\ncall to ... Actions 😜\nIf you're interested, my PR with the changes to the gitit workflows can be found\nhere.\nConfiguration\n\nExplanation\nHeader and build config\n\nStandard header. We name the workflow and configure the trigger using the on\nclause. While you can choose several triggers, you can only upload assets for\nreleases. If another event were to trigger the workflow the upload url used\nlater in the configuration would be missing.\nWe configure to run on all platforms available to github1 using the\nmatrix.\nImportant: GitHub also offers builds on Windows, but I haven't yet\ntranslated the steps to the shell used on windows. I know how to include\nplatform-dependent steps in the config, but I'm not familiar enough with the\nWindows shell to translate the commands. If you know what these commands would\nlook like on Windows, let me know.\nCheckout\n\nThe steps list the various commands we'd like to run. They can either call on\nactions (uses key) or sun shell commands (run key). This action here checks\nout the repo.\nCaching\n\nI've left this in here, but I'm sad to say it doesn't work for me. For some\nreason the key lookup always fails. If anyone has an idea why let me\nknow.\nBuilding\n\nBuild the project the usual way.\nIf you have additional assets you need to distribute with your executable I\nrecommend packaging it as a archive here. This reduces the download times.\nDealing with data-files (Haskell specific)\nSome Haskell libraries and executables rely on additional data-files and the\nPaths_package_name module, managed by cabal. If you get an\nerror that a certain file could not be opened when running the binary you\nuploaded as a asset, this is likely the reason. Especially if the path is\nsomething like /home/runner/.stack/snapshots/&lt;a long hash value&gt;/package-1.0.5/....\nThere are two components to fixing this error.\n\nYou must identify the files to include and\nOverwrite the paths cabal has baked into the program\n\nI describe how to do both of those shortly, but you may also like to look at\nthis gist\nwhich is a Haskell script that does both and copies the files to a directory\n(vendor-data/package-name).\n1. Finding assets\nIf the missing assets are from your project itself you can skip this step and\nmove on.\nWhen stack or cabal was building your project it will have stored asset files of\nall libraries and ghc-pkg knows where. To find the data directory of a library\n(say filestore) use the command ghc-pkg field filestore data-dir. If you are\nusing stack you should prepend stack exec -- before this command to make sure\nyou query the correct package database. This returns a string of the form\n\"data-dir: /home/user/...\\n\". So you need to strip off the \"data-dir: \"\nprefix, as well as the trailing \\n.\n1. Overwriting cabal paths\nLibraries that use the data-dir functionality interact with is typically using\nthe Paths_&lt;package name&gt; generated module. You can overwrite any paths set in\nthis module using environment variables. For instance, if I wanted to set the\ndata-file path for the filestore package to \"foo/bar\", I have to set the\nvariable filestore_datadir=foo/bar. This is documented here in\nthe cabal manual.\nMy solution for doing this automatically ist to not directly call the compiled\nbinary, but instead providing a shell script that sets these variables before\ncalling the actual program, forwarding any arguments. You can see an example of\nsuch a script\nhere.\nUpload\n\nThis is where the convenience of Actions really comes in. We can use the\npredefined\nupload-release-asset action\nwhich will deal with talking to the the GitHub API for us.

When you create a class you can specify class attributes in the class body and instance attributes in the init method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nHowever that is by no means final.\nPatching objects\nEven though you are encouraged to declare instance attributes in the initializer you are by no means required to do so. You can declare/assign instance attribute in any method and even outside the class at any point in the program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nAs you can see we can add attributes from inside another method. You can also remove the attributes from anywhere.\nSome things to learn from this\nDeclare your instance attributes in the initializer because you are guaranteed that this method will execute, or you probably will run into unexpected AttributeErrors somewhere down the line. Even initializing them with None is better than not initializing at all.\nNever add instance attributes from the outside. You may accidentally overwrite others or forget to do it and that would again cause name errors.\nExceptions from the rule\nThere are however some exceptions. For instance if you use a decorator to attach meta information to a function or class. It is okay to do here, because, again, you are guaranteed that the function is going to execute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nNote that we're attaching instance variables to a function. Functions are just objects, like anything else, so we're allowed to do that\nHow it works\nObjects in python are actually quite a simple construct.\nFor purposes of this article we can just think of objects as a combination of a class, the type of the object, and a so called instance dict.\nThe class, or type, is what we created when we were using the class keyword and it contains the methods and class attributes and reference to parent classes and so on.\nThe instance dict is a simple python dictionary that holds the instance variables.\nWhen an python object is created by the runtime the instance dict is actually empty1, no object actually has any instance attributes2, until the __init__ method is called. In the init method we are basically monkey patching in our instance attributes. This sets the key corresponding to the name of the attribute in the instance dict.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nPatching classes\nAs you may have guessed already, if we're allowed to attach attributes to a function, we are also allowed to attach attributes to a class.\nThere are two ways for obtaining the class from an object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nI personally prefer directly referring to __class__ if I'm about to tamper with it, but either one works fine.\nNow we can add/remove our class attributes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nHow it works\nIn python classes are just object. Instances of type. And like most objects their attributes can be freely modified, removed or added.3 They do have an instance dict __dict__ as well, however in this case it is not a vanilla python dict but rather a mappingproxy object. This is the interface the pytho interpreter shows for the instance dicts of lots of builtin types and objects, and this particular dict-like structure can not be modified directly. __setattr__ and __delattr__ however work on (most) types.\nThe fun stuff - advanced class patching\nWe've just learned that we can patch classes in python by modifying its instance dict, which contains the class attributes. You may be guessing it already, or you may have seen it, the instance dict of a class does not only contains the attributes but it also the methods that are defined on the class.\nFurthermore if you print one such method the output says the type is function, not method.\nIn fact python does not have methods per se. Instead there are functions contained in a classes instance dict. When you have an instance of the class and you print the method referencing from the instance you'll notice that the type changes from function to bound method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nBound methods are basically partially applied functions, where the first argument is the object the method has been called on.\nAs we can also see on line 25 a method can be called on the class directly which in which case you will have to provide the self argument yourself, what the type of that self argument is, is irrelevant, and not checked anywhere (by the language).\nSince methods are just functions until called, we can make the assumption, that they are in fact class attributes that happen to be callable. And in fact if you look at Python classes that is exactly the case. As a practical result of methods being nothing but class attributes and class instance dict being modifiable we can begin to assume that perhaps methods can be modified in just the same way.\nLet's see how it works:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n4\nDo remember that you have to add methods to the class, not the instance/object.\nNow please note that this is highly unsafe practice. Technically you can remove pretty much any method from any object and it is very hard to find where and if that has been done.\nThere is some fun stuff you can do now, since the methods you declared yourself are not the only thing you can change. This is an example of how you can overwrite __init__ to change the behaviour of a class during object instantiation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nHowever you do not have to stop there.\nThose that know how decorators work will be aware that they are just normal python functions and can be used as such.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nWe can use that fact to dynamically create classmethods and staticmethods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nI can actually think of very few ways that this can be useful. You should of course not apply this to live objects, since the consequences are highly opaque.\nOne way of using this though is to take a bunch of classes and add common or dynamically constructed methods to them.\nThe following is an example of a decorator that can be applied to a class and if there are public class variable in the class, whose value is a type, it will remove them and dynamically construct an __init__ method for the class which requires the names of those fields as keyword arguments, typechecks them and then adds them to the object.\nWe can easily construct this and then add this new __init__ method to our class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nYou could just as easily add more to this decorator. The fields it adds could be private by default and it could also add dynamic accessor methods. Instead of just writing types to the class attributes, you could provide further meta information and construct appropriate accessor methods or even not create fields at all and instead create field mimicking accessor methods using @property. This can be very useful if your object is tying to hide (or simplify) access to a database or external system by imitating a normal object but instead of accessing fields it may make a database or network connection or read from a file.\nAll in all it is I think useful to know that these things are possible, and if used correctly certainly can be a powerful tool. I like the possibilities but I also have never really used it in practice.\nLet me know if you'd be interested to see more 'useful' application of this concept and I might make another post about it.\n\n\n\nThis is true for any custom object. It can however be changed by using decorators or metaclasses. ↩\n\n\nThis is true for classes that do not define __slots__ which will in fact allocate named fields. ↩\n\n\nThis pretty much only applies to classes actually created using class, not to builtin types such as for example object, function and type itself. ↩\n\n\nThe added/reassigned/removed methods affect both new and old instances of the class (instantly). ↩\n\n\n\n","id":"https://justus.science/blog/monkey-patching/","title":"Next level monkey patching"},"https://justus.science/blog/new-logo/":{"body":"There's no favicon, that bothers me.\nI was thinking about reusing the old logo, but for some reason it does not appeal to me that much anymore.\nSo I was thinking I might design a new one. In the includes for the jekyll standard installation there's an embedded github logo (the one in the footer) which is a plain svg image and I very much like the idea of using a plain svg image as logo, because it is so easy to embed and does not take up any space.\nAs a result I spent this afternoon tinkering with svg and came up with something which I like for the moment.\n\nWhat I like is that it is very simple but also a little bit clever, because the lambda hidden within it is not all that visible.\nOr perhaps without the line at the bottom?\n\nOr perhaps another color?\n\nOr perhaps even filled?\n\nI actually quite like this one.

I challenge you :D .\nThe Website is written in Elm, the (Elm) source can be found on GitHub. The page itself is deployed on GitHub Pages.\nThe actual work is done by the backend server which is pure Haskell, deployed on Uberspace. And the source is available on GitHub as well.\nWhat it does\nschedule-planner is an application that, given a list of lessons and a list of rules, calculates the perfect layout for those lessons that adheres to the given rules as much as possible.\nCurrently you can define rules that select either days, timeslots or specific cells (specific timeslot on a specific day) and then assign a weight to it. The higher the weight, the more reluctant the algorithm will be to allocate lessons in that day/slot/cell.\nThe application is usable from the command line as a simple tool that takes a json file as input and either prints the result schedules to the command line or emits new json containing the resulting schedules.\nThe website is a convenient way of inputting the lessons and rules. Also it'll save your input in the browser, so nothing gets lost when you close the browser or reload.\nThere is lots I'd like to improve abut the interface and more features I'd like to add to the algorithm, but that'll have to wait.\nThe last kink\n... I faced was a ting called CORS, or cross origin resource sharing, or rather the lack of it by default. During the last year or so I have come in contact with many free services on the internet providing things like online IDE's, codesharing, source code hosting and project website hosting to name a few.\nGitHub is a service I am using constantly and recently I started also using GitHub pages a lot more, so I wanted to take advantage of the easy deployment via git on GitHub pages for this project as well. But since GitHub pages can only host static websites (and markdown), it could not run the Haskell server I am using as backend. So I put the webpage on github pages and deployed a static binary of the backend server, that does only the calculation, on my VM on Uberspace. This has the added benefit that GitHub pages now takes care of serving the html and relatively large javascript files, while the backend server only deals with a small amount of json for in- and output. This takes some load away from Uberspace.\nAs a result of having the website on GitHub and the calculation server on Uberspace, the domains for them are different. As a result most modern browsers will reject those communication between the two by default. Unless one sets a set of so called CORS headers, and it took me a while to do that properly.\nAt first I tried to do it by hand, just have the server emit the necessary headers all the time. That unfortunatley did not seem to work, so I tried adding a Haskell library to deal with CORS on the server side, which did not work either. For some reason the server middleware rejected the request outright, I can only assume it decided the requests the rowser was sending did not fulfill the expected CORS protocol.\nEven though adding the Library did not fix my problem, it thought me more about what CORS headers were there and how did they work. So when finally, in frustration, I turned back to the original idea of static headers, I could figure out which three headers were actually required (one of which I had forgotten before). Adding them to the request seems to do the trick now.\nThis does not make the site or your browser vulnerable, as far as I can tell, there's no reason to worry. Just try it and have some fun.\nLicensing\nBoth projects have an open source license (LGPL v3).

The canonical albeit still bad way is to import importlib and use importlib.reload(module).\nI'd like to take this opportunity to disclaim here immediately and sort of spoil the conclusion by stating that you should absolutely avoid reimporting any modules in python. As you'll see towards the end, things can get very messy very quickly when you reimport modules. It can cause severe bugs which can be virtually impossible to track down.\nIf you find yourself playing with the idea of reimporting modules in software that'll be used productively consider alternatives such as writing unittests (if you're using it to test code while developing), using multi-/subprocess to run the code in a separate interpreter, refactoring or simply restarting the interpreter.\nAlso in this article I deliberately try to make programs fail and break which is intended to explore features of the interpreter and standard library and not meant to be done in productive software.\nMessing with sys.modules\nDavid Beazley also mentions in his talk that the instance actually recording imported modules is located in sys.modules which happens to be a standard python dict.\nThe interesting thing about that is that unlike mappingproxy which is the dict-like object/wrapper/imitator that a lot of the builtin data structures (such as the dict itself) use to imitate a dict while avoiding modification1 and infinite recursion2 this sys.modules standard dict supports item assignment __setitem__ as well as deletion __delitem__.\nThis got me thinking \"How much does the sys.modules dict actually influence the import process.\" and as it turns out a lot and it allows you to mess with it.\nIf you import a module, let's call it test, modify the file and import again (in the same interpreter instance) nothing changes, you're still running the old code. But what happens if you delete the module from sys.modules first?\nThe answer: nothing at first. The code still runs, all functions that were in the module previously are still there, as is the module itself, but something odd happens if you execute import test again: it reimports the module.\n\n3\nConsequences\nThis is would per se not be all that bad, however this hacked reload does not facilitate the same behaviour as importlib.reload.\nThe difference between reloading the module this way, which I do not recommend anyone actually does, and using importlib.reload is that this particular way of reloading only reloads the module in the current namespace.\nLet's suppose we have two modules foo.py and bar.py where bar imports foo and uses a function defined therein:\n\nWe can then do the following experiment:\n\nAs you can see using importlib.reload reloads the module and references to the module are updated as well.4 This behavior is different if you reload using our dirty little trick.\n\nHere the reference to foo in bar is not being updated which seems to indicate that this import is overwriting the definition of the module wherever it is being kept and the old version of the code remains in the globals() dicts of the modules using it.\nWhat is sys.modules?\nAs we have seen deleting entries in sys.modules causes the interpreter to reload modules in import statements, but why is that and what are the entries in sys.modules?\nWell, sys.modules contains references to already imported modules. You can query it on the type of the entries and it tells you that the entries are actual modules, the same class/type you'd obtain when querying the module directly.\n\nIn fact the module reference in sys.modules is the the exact same object as your module itself.\n\nKnowing all this, here is a very crude sketch of how the __import__ function in python works which is the implementation of the import statement.\n\n5\nNow if we were to delete the entry from sys.modules __import__ would do the expensive import of the file again, since it cannot find the module in sys.modules. It then returns the new module and adds the reference to sys.modules which then would also point to the new module, however any module that imported name previously still has a reference to the module object in its globals() (or __dict__ if you prefer) dict and as such runs the old code.\nAs for the behavior of importlib.reload, it reloads the module back into the original module object and 'fixes' (though 'changes' might be the better term to use here) the references in-place.6 As a result any module that imported using import module and then uses module.attribute or module.function() instead of reassigning with from module import attribute or myattribute = module.attribute will now have the updated, reimported version of the code.7\nWhat it doesn't do however is remove any keys. This means if you imported a module bar with a function hello and you were to edit the file, removing the function entirely or commenting it out and then reimport the module using importlib.reload the new module object bar still has the hello attribute with the original function in it.\n\nConclusions\nWhat should one take away from it? Don't reimport modules.\nIt does not matter whether you use importlib.reload or something worse, unless you know exactly what you're doing and act very cautiously you're very likely to end up with code in a state, where some parts of the program have older and some parts have newer references to the code and there's no way for you to predict the outcome of a particular computation. Write unittests instead.\nHowever if you feel pathologically adventurous or absolutely require dynamic reloads, try to only keep references to the top level modules and reload them individually using importlib.\nGood luck, have fun and remember that collections is worth a look and use yield, it's awesome.\nFun facts and extras\nWhat happens with importlib.reload when you delete the module from sys.modules?\nIt fails. In order to reload the module it must be in sys.modules.\n\nThe same applies if you reassign sys.modules['bar'] = foo. You'll get the exact same error.\nMy crude implementation of importlib.reload\n\n8\n\n\n\ndict.__dict__.__getitem__ = 8 results in AttributeError: 'mappingproxy' object attribute '__getitem__' is read-only ↩\n\n\nOtherwise any dict would have an instance dict dict.__dict__ which would have an instance dict dict.__dict.__.__dict__ of type dict which would have an instance dict and so on. ↩\n\n\nThe reason why calling foo.hello refers to the new code instead of the old one, is because import overwrites it's value in our current globals() dict when we use it. As such it reloads the module for whatevernamespace we happened to be in. ↩\n\n\nThis does not work if you reassign contents of the imported module. I you do something like var = module.other_var change the value of other_var and reload var will still have the old value. That applies to functions and variables as well as from module import symbol imports.\nFrom this I can only assume that importlib.reload changes the module object in place rather than replace it. ↩\n\n\nThis, again, is not the actual implementation of the __import__ function but rather a very crude approximation for the purposes of this article. For instance this function could not deal at all with importing submodules, such as foo.bar ↩\n\n\nWhich you can actually do yourself. module objects are not immutable and you can freely assign, remove or alter any part of it module.foo = 0 or module.bar = lambda k: print(k) ↩\n\n\nThe same rules apply to if you've altered the module module.attribute = \"new value\" or module.function = lambda a: print(a, \"hello\"), only modules importing the base module import module will have updated refs module.attribute ==&gt; \"new value\", not modules using from module import attribute or myattr = module.attribute ==&gt; myattr == \"only value\" ↩\n\n\nAgain, this is not the official implementation and strongly simplified. It also does not interact with sys.modules, which we know it should/does, and it again only works for top-level modules. It is only here to illustrate how some of the behavior of the function could be implemented in python not how it is actually done. ↩\n\n\n\n","id":"https://justus.science/blog/sys-modules-is-dangerous/","title":"(Re)Importing in python - don't touch sys.modules"},"https://justus.science/blog/travis/":{"body":"Building Haskell code on travis is a bit complicated. Haskell happens to be one of the less well supported languages on travis.\nTravis ships with an older version of ghc (I think its 7.8) and cabal.

This requires building with either a different version of ghc or multiple ghc/base library versions.\nThere's a wonderful project by a github user named @hvr. The project itself is called multi-ghc-travis and provides an example .travis.yml which configures a matrix of build environments for travis based on as many ghc and cabal versions as you require by manually downloading and installing the necessary ghc ppa's on the build VM.\nThis is great and all, however bears a downside as it requires root privileges in the VM to add ppa's and install packages, which prohibits use of the new and faster, container based travis architecture.\nThere has been some nice development in container customization lately and as a result there's now a container compatible way of customizing your Haskell build environment on travis as this section of the README shows.\nThe even nicer thing is that the repository also provides you with a Haskell script that automatically creates the new-style .travis.yml from your tested-with section in your .cabal file. Simply provide the script with a .cabal file and pipe the output into a file called .travis.yml and you're pretty much set.\nNow I found it rather difficult to find information on how the tested-with section in a .cabal file should look.

Those version bounds are very similar to those of dependencies. Resulting in a field which looks something like this:\n\nThat's all I've got for now.
