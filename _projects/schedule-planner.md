The schedule planner is a tool written in [Haskell](//haskell.org) and [Python](//python.org) which allows you to calculate a perfect schedule out of any number of "lessons" and rules for how you would like them to be laid out.

__Typical Example__:
You're in University and have a bunch of subjects with fixed lectures and exercises to choose from. You'd prefer to not have any lessons in the morning from 7:30 - 9:00 (first timeslot) and you'd really hate it if you had lessons on a Friday.
The schedule planner can, based on this information, calculate the schedules that most follow these rules you have put in place and it will ensure that ultimately not a single subject is missed and there's a slot allocated for each.
