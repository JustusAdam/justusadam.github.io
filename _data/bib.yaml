    Type checkers are the most commonly used form of static analysis, but their
    design is coupled to the rest of the language, making it hard or impossible
    to bring new kinds of reasoning to existing unmodified code.

    We propose a novel approach to checking advanced type invariants and
    properties in unmodified source code, while retaining the speed and ease of
    simple syntax directed type checkers. The insight is that by combining a
    relatively deep program analysis (symbolic execution) with an unusual choice
    of program abstraction (based on program slicing), it appears possible to
    reconstitute type-checking as a special case of a more general analysis,
    which the abstraction reduces mostly to 'type-level' reasoning, largely
    discarding the 'value-level' work of the program.

    We implement a first simple prototype that demonstrates this idea by
    checking the safety of generic pointers in C, potentially bringing benefits
    roughly comparable with Milner's polymorphism.

    The Structured Query Language (SQL) is the de facto standard for database
    programming. SQL is a declarative language, letting programmers write short
    queries easily and allowing for aggressive performance optimizations.

    However this style diverges greatly from the widely used sequential
    programming style. This makes complex queries hard to write and understand
    [21].

    SQL also does not allow for the use of state. Algorithms that use state to
    achieve efficiency are impossible to implement [12]. State can only be used
    in so called User Defined Functions (UDF) which come with a significant
    performance penalty, because the optimizations are no longer available.

    In this work we improve upon the integration of imperative User Defined
    Functions. We use a the parallelizing compiler Ohua to generate query
    fragments from the UDF’s. These fragments run like native SQL queries and
    can benefit from database optimizations, such as parallelizing.

    The fragments contain operators generated by the compiler, which are state
    enabled. This allows us to express efficient stateful queries, as in [12].

    Dataflow execution models are used to build highly scalable parallel
    systems. A programming model that targets parallel dataflow execution must
    answer the following question: How can parallelism between two dependent
    nodes in a dataflow graph be exploited? This is difficult when the dataflow
    language or programming model is implemented by a monad, as is common in the
    functional community, since expressing dependence between nodes by a monadic
    bind suggests sequential execution.

    Even in monadic constructs that explicitly separate state from computation,
    problems arise due to the need to reason about opaquely defined state.
    Specifically, when abstractions of the chosen programming model do not
    enable adequate reasoning about state, it is difficult to detect parallelism
    between composed stateful computations.

    In this paper, we propose a programming model that enables the composition
    of stateful computations and still exposes opportunities for
    parallelization. We also introduce smap, a higher-order function that can
    exploit parallelism in stateful computations. We present an implementation
    of our programming model and `smap` in Haskell and show that basic concepts
    from functional reactive programming can be built on top of our programming
    model with little effort. We compare these implementations to a
    state-of-the-art approach using monad-par and LVars to expose parallelism
    explicitly and reach the same level of performance, showing that our
    programming model successfully extracts parallelism that is present in an
    algorithm. Further evaluation shows that smap is expressive enough to
    implement parallel reductions and our programming model resolves
    short-comings of the stream-based programming model for current
    state-of-the-art big data processing systems.

    Large infrastructures of Internet companies, such as Facebook and Twitter,
    are composed of several layers of micro-services. While this modularity
    provides scalability to the system, the I/O associated with each service
    request strongly impacts its performance. In this context, writing concise
    programs which execute I/O efficiently is especially challenging. In this
    paper, we introduce Ÿauhau, a novel compile-time solution. Ÿauhau reduces
    the number of I/O calls through rewrites on a simple expression language. To
    execute I/O concurrently, it lowers the expression language to a dataflow
    representation. Our approach can be used alongside an existing programming
    language, permitting the use of legacy code. We describe an implementation
    in the JVM and use it to evaluate our approach. Experiments show that Ÿauhau
    can significantly improve I/O, both in terms of the number of I/O calls and
    concurrent execution. Ÿauhau outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with
    similar goals.

    Big data systems scale with the number of cores in a cluster for the parts
    of an application that can be executed in data parallel fashion. It has been
    recently reported, however, that these systems fail to translate hardware
    improvements, such as increased network bandwidth, into a higher throughput.
    This is particularly the case for applications that have inherent
    sequential, computationally intensive phases. In this paper, we analyze the
    data processing cores of state-of-the-art big data systems to find the cause
    for these scalability problems. We identify design patterns in the code that
    are suitable for pipeline and task-level parallelism, potentially increasing
    application performance. As a proof of concept, we rewrite parts of the
    Hadoop MapReduce framework in an implicit parallel language that exploits
    this parallelism without adding code complexity. Our experiments on a data
    analytics workload show throughput speedups of up to 3.5x.

    Benchmarks are needed in order to test compiler and language-based
    approaches to optimize concurrency. These have tobe varied, yield
    reproducible results and allow comparisonbetween different approaches. In
    this paper, we propose aframework for generating synthetic benchmarks that
    aims atattaining these goals. Based on generating code from randomgraphs,
    our framework operates at a high level of abstraction.We test our
    benchmarking framework with a usecase, wherewe compare three
    state-of-the-art systems to optimize I/Oconcurrency in microservice-based
    software architectures.We show how using our benchmarks we can reliably
    comparebetween approaches, and even between the same approachusing different
    coding styles.

    The largest source of latency for many modern systems, particularly
    services, is the inherent latency of I/O operations. Disk I/O, database
    access and network bound communication is frequent, especially in data
    processing systems and distributed service infrastructures. Making I/O
    efficient is cumbersome, involves asynchronous programming and caching and
    hinders modularity when attempting to perform batch jobs. There have been a
    few solutions proposed to automate this, first and foremost Haxl, a Haskell
    library. We proposed an alternate, improved implementation called Ÿauhau. It
    leverages dataflow to produce even better performance while being
    independent from any particular code writing style in a minimal Embedded
    Domain-Specific Language (EDSL). In this thesis we first explore the
    techniques used by Ÿauhau to make I/O more efficient. Secondly we identify,
    explain and solve issues in Ÿauhau arising from control flow. Furthermore we
    suggest new optimisations for the compiler and implement safety guards for
    handling side effects.
