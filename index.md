Hello there,

My name is Justus Adam and I am a student of computer science at the [Technische
Universit√§t Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de).

#### What I am currently working on

- My masters thesis

  I am working to compile a lambda calculus based language
  ([Ohua](https://ohua-dev.github.io)) into database queries with user defined
  operators in [Noria](https://github.com/mit-pdos/noria)

  If you'd like a teaser, there are slides
  ([pdf](/slides/mt-intermediate-defence.pdf)|[pptx](/slides/mt-intermediate-defence.pptx))

## About me

I have been studying computer science at the TU Dresden since 2013. In 2016 I
finished my Bachelors degree [^1] and I am now in the process of writing my
masters thesis [^4].

My undergraduate studies were mostly concerned with the architecture of
distributed systems. I also work as a student research assistant at the [Chair
for Compiler Construction](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/ccc-about). The research
I am involved in centers around a parallelizing compiler called
[Ohua](http://ohua-dev.github.io/ohua/).

When I'm not studying or working I like to [climb low rock walls
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouldering) and I also sing in the
[university choire](https://unichor-dresden.de). I enjoy playing video
games and I play the piano.
