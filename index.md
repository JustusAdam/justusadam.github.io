## About me

I have been studying computer science at the TU Dresden since 2013. In 2016 I
finished my Bachelors degree[^1] and I am now in the process of writing my masters
thesis[^4].

My undergraduate studies were mostly concerned with the architecture of
distributed systems. I also work as a student research assistant at the [Chair
for Compiler Construction](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/ccc-about). The research
I am involved in centers around a parallelizing compiler called
Ohua [^2] [^3].

When I'm not at the university I like to [climb small
walls](https://kletterarena-dresden.de) (a sport called
["bouldering"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouldering)) and sing in the
[university choire](https://unichor-dresden.de). I also enjoy playing video
games and I occasionally play the piano.
