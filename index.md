Hello there,

My name is Justus Adam and I am a student of computer science at the [Technische
Universit√§t Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de) and I am also a student research
assistant at the [chair for compiler
construction](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/ccc-about).

### What I am currently working on

I am in the process of writing my masters thesis.

I am compiling a lambda calculus based language
([Ohua](https://ohua-dev.github.io)) into database queries with custom (user
defined) operators in [Noria](https://github.com/mit-pdos/noria).

The goal is to make it possible for users to write database queries in a subset
of either rust or ML with the ability to manipulate state and have the compiler
automatically generate operators and query fragments which allows the code to be
efficiently executed and parallelized and to leverage the unique advantages of
the noria system (very high throughput on reads).

If you'd like a teaser, there are slides [^5] I did for my intermediate defence
that show what the project is about. There are also old slides [^4] for the
topic introduction, but they are not up to date anymore.

## About me

I have been studying computer science at the TU Dresden since 2013. In 2016 I
finished my Bachelors degree [^1] and I am now in the process of writing my
masters thesis [^4].

My undergraduate studies were mostly concerned with the architecture of
distributed systems and I also have a passion for functional programming. I do
most of my coding in Haskell, if I can help it.

I also work as a student research assistant at the [Chair for Compiler
Construction](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/ccc-about). The research I am involved
in centers around a parallelizing compiler called
[Ohua](http://ohua-dev.github.io/ohua/).

When I'm not studying or working I like to [climb low rock walls
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouldering) and I also sing in the
[university choire](https://unichor-dresden.de). I enjoy playing video
games and I play the piano.
