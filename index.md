Hello there,

My name is Justus Adam and I am a PhD student at the [School of
Computing](https://cs.kent.ac.uk) at the [University of
Kent](https://kent.ac.uk.de). I work on stronger type-based program analysis
for languages with weak type systems, such as C or Java.

## About me

I studied computer science at the TU Dresden starting in 2013. In 2016 I
finished my Bachelors degree [^1] and in early 2020 my Masters.

My undergraduate studies were mostly concerned with the architecture of
distributed systems and I also have a passion for functional programming. I do
most of my coding in Haskell, if I can help it.

I also worked as a student research assistant at the [Chair for Compiler
Construction](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/ccc-about). The research I am involved
in centers around a parallelizing compiler called
[Ohua](http://ohua-dev.github.io/ohua/).

When I'm not studying or working I like to [climb low rock walls
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouldering) and I also sing in the
[university choire](https://unichor-dresden.de). I enjoy playing video
games and I play the piano.
