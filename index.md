## About me

I have been studying computer science at the TU Dresden since 2013. In 2016 I
did my Bachelors degree and I am now in the process of writing my masters
thesis.

My undergraduate studies were mostly concerned with the architecture of
distributed systems and my research so far centers around a parallelizing
compiler called [Ohua](https://ohua-dev.github.io/ohua/). You can find the
respective publications [here](/bib/).
