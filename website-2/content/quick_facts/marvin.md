I am writing a framework for chatbots a la [hubot](https://hubot.github.com){:target="_blank"} in Haskell, called [marvin](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/marvin){:target="_blank"}.
You can use it to write your own chatbots, heres the [documentation](https://marvin.readthedocs.io){:target="_blank"}.
And if you would like to see it in action, there's a test slack for it [here](https://marvin-bot.slack.com){:target="_blank"} send me an [email](mailto:dev@justus.science) if you'd like an invite.
