## About me

I studied computer science at the TU Dresden starting in 2013. In 2016 I
finished my Bachelors degree[^1] and in early 2020 my Masters[^2].

My undergraduate studies were mostly concerned with the architecture of
distributed systems and I also have a passion for functional programming and
programming language design. My preferred languages are Haskell and Rust.

I also worked as a student research assistant at the [Chair for Compiler
Construction](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/ccc-about) with work centering around
a parallelizing compiler called [Ohua](http://ohua-dev.github.io/ohua/).

In my spare time I like to climb and boulder, both indoors and outdoors. During
the warmer months I like to hike and during the colder ones you'll likely find
me on a ski slope. I enjoy playing video games, making music and learning how to
solve the big issues of our time, like inequality and climate change.
