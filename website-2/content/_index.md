Welcome to this, my website.

I'm Justus and I am a PhD student advised by <a target="_blank" href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/malte/">Malte Schwarzkopf </a> at the
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a> at
<a href="https://brown.edu" target="_blank">Brown University</a>. I am part of the of the
_<a href="https://etos.cs.brown.edu" target="_blank">Efficient and Trustworthy Operating Systems</a>_

## Things I work on

My latest project is **Paralegal**, a static analyzer that finds violations of privacy or security policies in Rust code. The tool supports arbitrary Rust codebases and requires no changes to the application code, other than a few annotations. It supports custom privacy and security policies which lets you tailor the tool to your specific domain and use case. It can also be used on library-only crates. If this interests you, check out the <a href="https://brownsys.github.io/paralegal/" target="_blank">online documentation</a> and the <a href="//github.com/brownsys/paralegal" target="_blank">repository</a>.

I contributed to **Kani**, a model checker for Rust programs. I designed and implemented the first contract mechanism for Kani, which enables users to take advantage of modular verification where they can first verify a function against its contract and then use the contract as a cheap assumption when verifying callers. For more information, see my [blog post](https://model-checking.github.io/kani-verifier-blog/2024/01/29/function-contracts.html) on the Kani blog.

I contributed to **Ohua**, a parallelizing compiler. Among other things I implemented an optimization that batches I/O operations to reduce network roundtrips. You can find more information about the compiler on the [website](https://ohua-dev.github.io/).

### Personal stuff

In my spare time I like to climb and boulder, both indoors and outdoors. During
the warmer months you'll find me hiking a mountain and during the colder ones on a ski slope if I can help it.
I enjoy playing video games, making music and learning about the big issues of our time, like inequality and climate change.
