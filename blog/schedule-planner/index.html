<p>Today I worked out the last (major, known to me) kink of my schedule-planner web-app.</p>
<p>It is <a href="http://justus.science/schedule-planner-web/">live right now</a> (and should work as expected).</p>
<p>Feel free to try it and find bugs. I challenge you :D .</p>
<p>The Website is written in <a href="http://elm-lang.org">Elm</a>, the (Elm) source can be found on <a href="https://github.com/JustusAdam/schedule-planner-web">GitHub</a>. The page itself is deployed on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
<p>The actual work is done by the backend server which is pure <a href="https://haskell.org">Haskell</a>, deployed on <a href="http://uberspace.de">Uberspace</a>. And the source is available on <a href="https://github.com/JustusAdam/schedule-planner">GitHub</a> as well.</p>
<h2 id="what-it-does">What it does</h2>
<p>schedule-planner is an application that, given a list of lessons and a list of rules, calculates the perfect layout for those lessons that adheres to the given rules as much as possible.</p>
<p>Currently you can define rules that select either days, timeslots or specific cells (specific timeslot on a specific day) and then assign a weight to it. The higher the weight, the more reluctant the algorithm will be to allocate lessons in that day/slot/cell.</p>
<p>The application is usable from the command line as a simple tool that takes a json file as input and either prints the result schedules to the command line or emits new json containing the resulting schedules.</p>
<p>The website is a convenient way of inputting the lessons and rules. Also it'll save your input in the browser, so nothing gets lost when you close the browser or reload.</p>
<p>There is lots I'd like to improve abut the interface and more features I'd like to add to the algorithm, but that'll have to wait.</p>
<h2 id="the-last-kink">The last kink</h2>
<p>... I faced was a ting called CORS, or cross origin resource sharing, or rather the lack of it by default. During the last year or so I have come in contact with many free services on the internet providing things like <a href="https://c9.io">online IDE's</a>, <a href="http://hastebin.com">codesharing</a>, <a href="https://github.com">source code hosting</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com">project website hosting</a> to name a few.
GitHub is a service I am using constantly and recently I started also using GitHub pages a lot more, so I wanted to take advantage of the easy deployment via git on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub pages</a> for this project as well. But since GitHub pages can only host static websites (and markdown), it could not run the Haskell server I am using as backend. So I put the webpage on github pages and deployed a static binary of the backend server, that does only the calculation, on my VM on <a href="http://uberspace.de">Uberspace</a>. This has the added benefit that GitHub pages now takes care of serving the html and relatively large javascript files, while the backend server only deals with a small amount of json for in- and output. This takes some load away from Uberspace.</p>
<p>As a result of having the website on GitHub and the calculation server on Uberspace, the domains for them are different. As a result most modern browsers will reject those communication between the two by default. Unless one sets a set of so called CORS headers, and it took me a while to do that properly.</p>
<p>At first I tried to do it by hand, just have the server emit the necessary headers all the time. That unfortunatley did not seem to work, so I tried adding a Haskell library to deal with CORS on the server side, which did not work either. For some reason the server middleware rejected the request outright, I can only assume it decided the requests the rowser was sending did not fulfill the expected CORS protocol.</p>
<p>Even though adding the Library did not fix my problem, it thought me more about what CORS headers were there and how did they work. So when finally, in frustration, I turned back to the original idea of static headers, I could figure out which three headers were actually required (one of which I had forgotten before). Adding them to the request seems to do the trick now.</p>
<p>This does not make the site or your browser vulnerable, as far as I can tell, there's no reason to worry. Just try it and have some fun.</p>
<h2 id="licensing">Licensing</h2>
<p>Both projects have an open source license (LGPL v3). Feel free to use the code as you'd like, I'd appreciate it if you'd contribute, should you have ideas for improvement/be interested in advancing the project.</p>
