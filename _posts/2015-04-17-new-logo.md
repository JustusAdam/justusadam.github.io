title: A logo would be nice.

There's no favicon, that bothers me.

I was thinking about reusing the old logo, but for some reason it does not appeal to me that much anymore.

So I was thinking I might design a new one. In the includes for the jekyll standard installation there's an embedded github logo (the one in the footer) which is a plain svg image and I very much like the idea of using a plain svg image as logo, because it is so easy to embed and does not take up any space.

As a result I spent this afternoon tinkering with svg and came up with something which I like for the moment.

![A lambda logo](/images/lambda-logo.svg)

What I like is that it is very simple but also a little bit clever, because the lambda hidden within it is not all that visible.
