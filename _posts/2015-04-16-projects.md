title: Projects again?

So I have this idea ...

On the old page I used to have not only my blog but also an ordered collection of pages dedicated to the projects I was currently working on or had finished.

I feel like I should do that again but a little bit different this time. So here's what I'm thinking: most of my projects are hosted on [GitHub](//github.com) now and because I can easily add github pages to any project it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to add some kind of documentation to the projects on this site specifically.
BUT what I think might be good is more of a personal approach to the project. Why I started it, how I feel about the tools used and the progress it has made.

Fortunately Jekyll offers custom collections so it shouldn't be too hard to write a n overview page and get all the pages nice and organized.
