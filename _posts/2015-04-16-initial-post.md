I love markdown. And I am too lazy to keep my old website updated. So, when
[Kilian](//kilian.io) tweeted he'd moved his personal website over to
[github pages](//pages.github.io) I got tempted to do the same and continue the
site and perhaps the blog?? at github pages.

So here we are. This is now hosted by the awesome and generous
[Github website](//github.com), written in markdown using [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com)
to compile html.

Unfortunately it also means that there will no longer be the option to comment
on posts, but it also means a lot less work for me keeping things clean and
updated. Plus it makes the site waaay faster and I can write this stuff
comfortably in [atom editor](//atom.io).
